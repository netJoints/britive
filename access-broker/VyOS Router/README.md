# Britive Access Broker VyOS ZSP Sample Scripts

This repository contains sample scripts designed to demonstrate the integration of Britive's Access Broker with VyOS routers, enabling Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP) for enhanced security and dynamic access management.

## Overview

Britive's Access Broker extends the power of Cloud Privileged Access Management (CPAM) to on-premises and hybrid environments. These scripts showcase how to leverage Britive's capabilities to achieve:

- Just-In-Time (JIT) ephemeral access to VyOS routers.
- Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP) for secure and compliant operations.
- Simplified and automated access management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Access Control**: Automate the provisioning and revocation of access to VyOS routers.
- **Zero Trust Security**: Enforce least privilege principles with time-bound permissions.
- **Integration Ready**: Easily integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure.
